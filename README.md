Render Engine in OpenGL. 

At some point the engine is supposed to become a strategy game engine, learning opengl/graphics programming is currently the main focus.


Current feature of the Render Engine:\
-> 3D/2D space objects via the typical buffers, shaders\
-> use of projection, view and model matrices\
-> implemented a camera class\
-> Texture loading

To-Do's for now:\
-> Lightning\
-> Model Loading
